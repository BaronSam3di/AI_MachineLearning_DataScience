    "\n",
    "Every estimator ( Linear Regression, SVM etc ) has its advantages and drawbacks. Its generalization error can be decomposed in terms of bias, variance and noise. \n",
    "- The **bias** of an estimator is its average error for different training sets. These are the errors.\n",
    "- The **variance** of an estimator indicates how sensitive it is to varying training sets. \n",
    "- Noise is a property of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias and variance are inherent properties of estimators and we usually have to select learning algorithms and hyperparameters so that both bias and variance are as low as possible. Another way to reduce the variance of a model is to use more training data. However, you should only collect more training data if the true function is too complex to be approximated by an estimator with a lower variance. \n",

    "\n",
    "* ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) was developed in 1986 by Ross Quinlan. The algorithm creates a multiway tree, finding for each node (i.e. in a greedy manner) the categorical feature that will yield the largest information gain for categorical targets. Trees are grown to their maximum size and then a pruning step is usually applied to improve the ability of the tree to generalise to unseen data.\n",

Ie : it takes all the data and chops it up into n catagories. C4.5 converts the trained trees (i.e. the output of the ID3 algorithm) into sets of if-then rules. These accuracy of each rule is then evaluated to determine the order in which they should be applied. Pruning is done by removing a rule’s precondition if the accuracy of the rule improves without it.\n",
